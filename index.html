						"title":"How to Handle a Frigid New York Winter ","text":"Don't assume that we're going to breeze through winter this year. Just because the temperatures have been hovering around 60 degrees in December, that doesn't mean New York's winter will be a mild one. In fact, according to predictions, we should expect a lot of snow this season, and possibly a Nor'easter or two! That being said, most of us New Yorkers will vouch -- winters can be brutal here. In fact, many of us dread January and February and count the days until spring. I'm not trying to scare you newbies who are about to bear your first cold-weather season in the Big Apple. I'm not trying to intimidate you warm-weather-loving NYC fans who anticipate a move shortly, either. I am, however, trying to give you the lowdown on how we manage to handle the frigid winters year after year in NYC. To start -- if you're in the midst of your first freeze, please don't head for the hills before March hits! (March tends to be a little milder than February.) Do yourself a favor and hang in there. I promise April and May can be fantastic, and you'll long forget that winter ever happened. (Well, not really!) In all seriousness, there's a handful of ways to cope with the rip-roaring Arctic air and snowy winters in Gotham. Dont leave the apartment - is one solution, albeit not a very practical one. (Although, if I'm honest, I've done it a few times.)For my suggestions how to handle a New York winter, move on over to the Cubesmart blog, where I offer up some pretty practical tips how to stick out those few frosty months each year, and do it with grace and in style.",

						"title":"Top 10 Free Things to Do in New York City", "text":" <b>#1: Roam a Random Neighborhood </b></br></br> Part of the joy of New York is the energy, unique feel and character of each neighborhood. 'Wandering though Greenwich Village is always fun,' Ferate said. But these days, 'You're not going to find any struggling artists in Greenwich Village.' Instead -- or in addition -- he suggests taking a stroll through nearby NoLita (for North of Little Italy.) 'It's younger, it's hipper. I think it's got more vitality,' Ferate said. For those willing to venture outside of Manhattan, hop on the L train and go to the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, getting off a the Bedford Avenue stop. Pop into galleries, unique stores and just enjoy the vibe of a different neighborhood. It's right across the river from Manhattan, but feels miles away. 'Walking along Bedford Avenue is just a treat unto itself,' Ferate said. </br></br><b> #2: Free Museums </b></br></br> Admission to New York's museums can cost up to $20 a person. But most intuitions offer free days or nights. The Museum of Modern Art offers free admission every Friday from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. The Brooklyn Museum is free on the first Saturday of every month from 5 p.m. to 11 p.m. But a warning: Get there early. These free days aren't so secret anymore and lines are often lengthy. The Metropolitan Museum of Art and American Museum of Natural History both just have 'suggested admissions' -- $20 and $15 respectively -- which means you can pay whatever you feel is appropriate, even if that is nothing. Then there are simply free museums. Don't let their price dissuade you … these are some amazing collections. The Museum at Fashion Institute of Technology. The National Museum of the American Indian is part of the Smithsonian Institution and always free. The Sony Wonder Technology Lab brings technology and creativity together to make learning experiential, entertaining and fun. The New York Transit Museum operates a gallery annex in Grand Central Terminal that presents changing exhibitions. The gallery annex is located just off the main concourse, next to the station master's office. </br></br><b> #3: Be Part of a Television Studio Audience </b></br></br> Countless TV shows are shot in New York, many before live studio audiences. Tickets go fast for these shows, but if you plan well in advance you are likely to get free tickets to see your favorite stars. <b></br></br> #4: Walking Tours </b></br></br> Each Friday at 12:30 p.m., Ferate offers a tour of Grand Central Terminal and the surrounding neighborhood. The Grand Central Partnership pays him to do it, meaning it's free for you and me.Join the Times Square Alliance every Friday at noon for 'Times Square Exposé,' a free, behind-the-scenes walking tour of Times Square. Visit historic theatres, new sites, and the best of the neighborhood during this tour of the Crossroads of the World.For something less traditional, head to the Lower East Side on Sundays at 11 a.m. for a three-hour tour looking at the neighborhood's history, from the arrival of immigrants to the arrival of high-priced apartments. Meet in front of Katz's Delicatessen, where Harry and Sally had an orgasmic sandwich.The Central Park Conservancy offers a wide variety of free walking tours through various sections of the park. Big Apple Greeter offers locals -- not professional tour guides -- who show visitors around their neighborhood, providing a uniquely New York view of a sliver of the city.</br></br><b> #5: Tour the World's Largest Gold Vault </b></br></br> The New York branch of the Federal Reserve is also home to the largest known deposit of gold. Free tours are given Monday through Friday, except Bank holidays, at 9:30 a.m., 10:30 a.m., 11:30 a.m., 1:30 p.m., 2:30 p.m. and 3:30 p.m. The tour lasts approximately 60 minutes, but must be booked well in advance since there are only 30 spots. </br></br><b> #6: Visit a Church </br></br></b> New York has many grand churches and cathedrals worth checking out. Several offer tours and all are open for the public to at least poke their heads in. Some favorites include: Trinity Church, Saint Patrick's Cathedral, the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, The Church of the Intercession in Harlem and Saint Bartholomew's. <b></br></br> #7: New York's Hippest Elevated Park</b> </br></br> New York has transformed an old, abandoned elevated freight train track into a beautiful park which offers a unique view of the city and the waterfront. It's called the High Line, and on weekends, thousands of locals and tourists flock there to hang out. There are also often free art instillations. </br></br><b> #8: Brewery Tours </br></br></b> The Brooklyn Brewery Offers free tours every hour on the hour each weekend starting at 1 p.m., with last tours at 5 p.m. on Saturdays and 4 p.m. on Sundays. You will have to still pay for your beer but hey the education is free and who says you need to actually have a drink?In Manhattan, the Chelsea Brewing Co. offers free tours Saturday on the hour from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. <b></br></br> #9: A Ferry Ride With a View </br></br> </b>The Staten Island Ferry moves 60,000 passengers a day between Lower Manhattan and Staten Island. The five-mile, 25 minute ride gives you majestic views of New York Harbor, the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island plus the skyscrapers and bridges of Manhattan. </br></br><b> #10: Cross the East River on Foot or Tram</b> </br></br> No visit to New York is complete without a walk across the Brooklyn Bridge. But another way, further uptown, to cross the river is the Roosevelt Island Tram. While not technically free, you can pay for it with your unlimited MetroCard that you probably purchased for the subway and bus system. The three-minute ride offers spectacular views of Manhattan and the nearby United Nations. The tram has been featured in several movies and TV shows including the 2002 film 'Spider-Man.'",

						"title":"Top 5 Best Ice Cream places in NYC","text":"<i>Ice cream is inarguably the most delicious of all summer treats, whether it's slathered with boozeor simply perched on a crunchy cake cone. And even though it seems like those self-serve frozen yogurt shops are out to stamp its full-fat forebear into the ground, there are still plenty of excellent spots in town to pick up your favorite dairy delight. Here are our favorites; we know you'll leave yours in the comments.</i></br></br>BIG GAY ICE CREAM: For those of us who worship at the soft-serve altar, this native New Yorker is the top of the heap. Proprietors Douglas Quint and Bryan Petroff got their start in town in 2009, serving up playful cups and cones out of a truck. The truck has since temporarily retired, but Quint and Petroff have opened two brick-and-mortar spots in the East and West Villages. Go for the classic Salty Pimp, a delectable chocolate-dip covered vanilla ice cream cone combined with Dulce de Leche and sea salt; they've also got a rotating shake list and a long list of toppings for DIY flavoring. Mister Softee ain't got nothing on this jam.<br></br>ODDFELLOWS: Year-old OddFellows's thing is homemade ice cream, and they dole out plenty of it, offering a long list of fresh, tasty and unique flavors at their Brooklyn and Manhattan shops. You can still get the semi-basics—Tahitian Vanilla, Coffee Crunch, Chocolate Chunk—but the OddFellows gang whips up a rotating list of more creative fare, like Buttermilk Spiced Apple; Lemon, Honey & Ginger; Black Chocolate Stout and Beet Goat Cheese & Candied Pistachio. And if you prefer your ice cream in semi-liquid form, the milkshakes here are otherwordly; indulge if you dare.</br></br>BLUE MARBLE: Blue Marble's another one of those organic Brooklyn shops, boasting creamy, mostly classic flavors. We went crazy over them last year when they started shelling out Burnt Sugar, a flavor transplanted all the way from Boston. They've got plenty of other five-star worthy offerings on tap, too: the Sweet Tart Strawberry is a particular favorite, along with chemical-free goodies like Banana Chip, Mexican Chocolate Chip and Butter Pecan. They've also got shakes and other ice-cream-ey treats, plus you can score tubs and pints at retailers around town.</br></br>EDDIE'S SWEET SHOP: This lovely decades-old Forest Hills ice cream parlor rocks it old school, complete with heaping sundaes topped with hot fudge and fresh-made whipped cream, classic egg creams, banana splits, thick shakes and sodas. All the ice cream here is homemade with palpable care, and there's plenty of room to sit at the restaurant's marble counter, metal stools and all. Cash only, because this baby rolls a VINTAGE cash register. Amazing.</br></br>VAN LEEUWEN ARTISAN ICE CREAM: We've given Van Leeuwen love for its stellar food truckbefore, and the fine organic ice cream served up at its brick-and-mortar stores hits the spot just the same. Van Leeuwen's stuff is made with hormone-and antibiotic-free milk and cream, along with egg yolks and cane sugar, so you don't have to feel bad for hurting all those cows with chemicals while you stuff your face with Mint Chip and Sweet Sticky Black Rice. Plus, they've got a solid line of vegan ice cream you can enjoy if you're off dairy, and the odd sorbet flavor or two, though the Greenpoint establishment did not have any last time I was in, FOR SHAME.",

						"title":"Ten Best Cheesecake in NYC","text":"<i>It seems like pizza, hot dogs, and bagels get all the love when talking about iconic New York food. But let's not forget the humble cheesecake. It was invented long ago by the Greeks, modified by the Romans, and eventually came into its own here in New York. The Italians claim pizza, the Germans get hot dogs, the Jews have the bagels-but the cheesecake belongs to all New Yorkers. Here are my favorite, and hence the best, cheesecakes in the city. </br></br> </i><b>EILEEN'S SPECIAL CHEESECAKE</b></br></br> The debate rages on over NY-style (dense, cream cheese based) and Italian-style (light, ricotta based). For those that like something in the middle with the perfect balance between dense and fluffy, sweet and tart, we have Eileen's. Cheesecakes here come in three different sizes-not to mention a personal mini option. The thin graham cracker crust adds just the right amount of texture and Eileen's gets major points for branching out from the usual strawberry and marble by rotating over 25 different flavors, including Salted Caramel, Peanut Butter, and my personal favorite, Chocolate Bourbon.<b></br></br>TWO LITTLE RED HENS</b></br></br> Two Little Red Hens gets a lot of attention for their Instagram-worthy cupcakes, but the real star here is the ethereal New York cheesecake. Crowned with a stunning browned top and finished with a buttery, crunchy graham cracker crust, this specimen is a study in cheesecake textures. The base itself is a heavenly cloud of silky perfection-walking that fine line between sweet and sour. It's everything a New York cheesecake should be. <b></br></br>LA CHEESECAKE BAKE SHOP</b></br></br> Some cheesecakes sit on a graham cracker crust, others go crustless, and some have a spongey cake bottom. The only place I've encountered that gets the sponge crust just right is La Cheesecake, in College Point, Queens. The production bakery doesn't have a seating area, but welcomes visitors to buy full cheesecakes or an array of miniature ones. Their cheesecake has a smooth, creamy center featuring that unmistakable cream cheese tang. The sponge cake crust remains firm and fresh providing a wonderful base for the cake above.<b></br></br>S & S CHEESECAKE</b></br></br> While this old-school kosher bakery has a small retail storefront, they don't receive many visitors. The commercial kitchen is only open weekdays until 3 p.m. and it's located in a residential neighborhood of the Bronx. Once you arrive, you can only buy full cakes to take with you, no sitting around and eating the slices on premises. It's well-worth the trip because this is the best all-cream-cheese-cake in the borough-smooth and rich, browned on the edges with the proper sweet to tart ratio. The light spongey crust feels like an exciting extension of the creamy slice. If you can't make it to the Bronx, their cheesecake is also sold by the slice at some local restaurants, including Peter Luger. <b></br></br>FAIRWAY MARKET</b></br></br> Sometimes you are picking up your groceries for the week when a cheesecake craving strikes. Most NYC grocery stores stock the ubiquitous dessert, but few bake the cheesecake themselves. Fairway concocts the best grocery store option at their commercial bakery up in Harlem. Available as a slice or a full cake, it puts the other pre-packaged options to shame. It leans on the tangy side, with just a hint of sweetness and its dense texture easily melts in your mouth. This should be at the top of every grocery list!<b></br></br>JEAN DANET PASTRY</b></br></br> Only in this city could you find excellent New York cheesecake at a French bakery in the middle of an Italian neighborhood. ﻿Truth be told, the current owner of Jean Danet is Pat Giura, who is Italian, but classically trained in French pastry. So let's call the pastries Italian-French fusion. Regardless, he makes a beautifully composed slice of cheesecake. He trades in a crust for whipped cream and a gorgeous glazed strawberry. The sweet flavors are tamed with sharp cream cheese notes that also add to the pastry's velvety texture.<b></br></br>MARTHA'S COUNTRY BAKERY</b></br></br> The Greeks invented cheesecake back in ancient times as an energy booster for participants in the first Olympic Games. If only it was still considered health food! Martha's Country Bakery is a Greek owned bakery in Queens that is making an exceptional cheesecake, though I can't imagine it resembles that original ancient recipe. The options here include Missippi Mud and Lemon Coconut, but I like to stick to the original. Topped with a large strawberry, the tangy cake has a hint of lemon and remains both creamy and decadent. <b></br></br>FERRARA BAKERY & CAFE</b></br></br> Many people have written off the Little Italy neighborhood as a tourist trap, and in some cases, that's true. But then you'd miss the fine pastries that Ferrara, the oldest espresso bar in America, is whipping up. Past the rainbow cookies and cannolis, you can find stellar examples of both New York and Italian-style cheesecake. The first is dense and smooth while the other is fluffy and citrusy (with bits of candied orange peel hidden in the base). Just come at an off-hour to avoid the guide book-toting tourists.<b></br></br>CHIKALICIOUS DESSERT BAR</b></br></br> And then we come to the rebels. Cheesecake has a history of being re-invented and pastry chefs throughout New York today are having fun with it. My favorite is the now legendary sphere at Chikalicious Dessert Bar. Owner Chika Tillman turns her back on the dense versus fluffy debate and makes something brand new. This stark white orb is part of a $16 prix fixe menu and can only be described as a cheesecake cloud. Composed of fromage blanc, the delicate whipped cream-like texture sits in an island of sweet creme anglaise. It's a true game changer.<b></br></br>BREADS BAKERY</b></br></br> This place gets all the attention for its amazing chocolate babka, but it should be a crime to overlook their impeccable cheesecake. Israeli Chef Uri Scheft doesn't take sides when it comes to the Italian versus NY cheesecake debate. His original creation is dusted with powdered sugar and backed by a soft crust. It's impossibly light and airy with a hit of lemon coming through the cream cheese tang. It's almost as if New York cheesecake and lemon meringue pie had a lovechild. Let's be thankful there's no cheeky name for this dessert hybrid. ",

						"title":"How Busy New Yorkers Can Get More Done in Less Time ","text":"<i>Time rarely seems to drag while living in New York City. If anything, I find myself wondering how the hours, days, weeks, and months seem to fly by -- all the while, leaving me feeling as if I haven't accomplished anything during that period. This year, fortunately, I have discovered several ways to blast through my tasks and get things done in less time than I did before.</i></br></br><b>Write it down. </br></br></b>I've said it a million times, and I'll say it again: busy New Yorkers can get more done in less time with a good to-do list. Once you write out everything you need to accomplish, pinpoint the top three tasks that are the most important and get those out of the way first.</br></br><b>Expedite your list.</br></br></b>Do you need to write thank you cards, help a friend with his or her resume, or return an email from a relative? Be picky about your priorities. Chances are, you have far more pressing items on your agenda, such as compiling a report for your boss, preparing for a presentation, or emailing a business proposal to a potential client. Get those tasks out of the way first, and then you can tackle the remainder of your list.</br></br><b>Silence your phone.</br></br></b>New Yorkers are known for spending too much time on their phones. You'll notice this as you try and navigate the streets, only to be slowed down due to a fellow pedestrian texting, Facebooking, or reading emails. (Yes, we're all guilty.) Our brains aren't programmed to handle the number of notifications and amount of information we receive daily. Also, it's all a huge distraction when you're trying to work. Put your phone on silent and ignore it until you've completed the task at hand.</br></br><b>Close extra tabs and programs on your computer.</br></br></b>The point here is to eliminate any potential distractions. I'm guilty of watching shows on YouTube or Gchatting with my friends (who are in various offices around the city) while 'trying' to work. I have also left the Facebook tab open on several occasions, only for someone to message me and make me forget about the project I'm supposed to be finishing.Now, I make sure not to have any extra browser tabs open while working. And if I'm writing, I'll even put my laptop on airplane mode so I won't be tempted to open Firefox and start looking through the newest collection at Victoria's Secret - or watch a video of cats being scared of cucumbers. This alone has helped me meet my deadlines.</br><b></br>Work in intervals.</br></br></b>Whether it's business or mundane chores, create intervals of focused work and take breaks in between. I give myself 40-50 minutes at a time to work, and then purposely step away for 10 minutes. It allows me to mentally recuperate, so I'm able to focus again once it's time to plow through the next work interval, and I'm usually able to get everything done in about four hours.</br></br><b>Outsource.</br></br></b>Sometimes, we can't do everything on our own. Even though I prefer to do laundry and housework myself, if you're incredibly pressed for time - and if it's in your budget - hire a cleaning person or use one of NYC's many wash-and-fold services. Saving yourself a couple hours here and there is enough to get more done, or simply schedule an outing with friends.</br></br><b>Order in.</br></br></b>Hosting a cocktail party or having guests over for dinner? Take advantage of New York City's convenience factor and order in. Whenever it's my turn to host my book club's monthly meeting, I save a lot of time just by having the wine delivered to my apartment while I prep the food. There's also a wealth of fantastic places that cater, so you can spend even less time in the kitchen.",

						"title":"You'll Never Be Alone in New York ","text":"<i>In New York City, you can never be truly alone. To some Americans, this is the reason why they choose to live elsewhere. To New Yorkers, it is one of the things that makes the city unique --- you can go out alone yet never feel lonely.</i></br></br>My cube mates laugh and often say, 'Going straight home does not make you a failure, Michelle.'</br>For me, the thought of heading directly home after work sometimes feels worse than getting out of bed for work in the morning. So, you ask, what do I end up doing on those nights when I'm just dying to be out? Do I resist and go home and watch The West Wing on Netflix? Sit in bed all evening with my iPad and plan vacations on Pinterest that I can’t afford? No to all of the above.</br>I frequently step out of my comfort zone and go out alone since living with two roommates can sometimes be too much to handle. Flying solo in New York may sound scary, but it's always worth it because I learn something each time I do it. I refuse to sit home just because I don't have a date on my arm (my boyfriend lives an hour away), or because my friends aren't available to get together with our conflicting schedules.</br>I've pulled together a few of my favorite things to do in New York while going it alone and loving it. You'd be amazed at what I've discovered unexpectedly along the way.<b></br></br>Head to a coffee shop</b></br></br>Just last weekend, I told myself I should be out doing something, so I went to Le Churro, down the block from my apartment on the Upper East Side. I started to write this article as I sipped my iced coffee. To my right was a trio of three twenty-something girls discussing restaurants. I laughed to myself because it seems like New Yorkers, regardless of the setting, will always end up talking about restaurants and neighborhoods. Food is our pastime.One girl said, 'I usually feel bad eating at the same restaurant twice, but I've been to Flex Mussels like four times.' (Note to self: try Flex Mussels). I can definitely relate. The inevitable eavesdropping in the tiny coffee shop helped to validate my choice to forgo my morning coffee in my pajamas and venture outside.<b></br></br>Go out after work</b></br></br>If I am going to get a drink by myself it's gotta be tasty. The Grey Dog serves warm spiced wine in a heaping 12 oz. mug full of raisins and almond slivers. The vibe inside is chill, yet vibrant and eclectic. I've learned the key to going to a bar without a buddy is to remain confident and relaxed. Putting your phone away isn't a bad idea either. Be open to socializing with the bartender or other drinkers. You never know -- it could end up being a fun way to unwind after work, network, or make a new friend.<b></br></br>Downtown choice</b></br></br>I like to walk through Union Square GreenMarket. 	I pick up some veggies for the week, grab dinner at Dig Inn, where there are just as many solo diners as groups or couples, then maybe browse through the dollar books outside of The Strand. That is my idea of the perfect solo date.The trendy hipster crowd and savory farm-to-table menu may look intimidating to conquer alone, but indulging in a meal at Back Forty in the East Village is totally worth it, even alone, and it's much better than eating Seamless delivery on my couch. <b></br></br>Uptown choice</b></br></br>If I am in my Upper East Side neighborhood without plans, I may get a few mini cupcakes at Two Little Red Hens, and after indulging, see a movie at 83rd and 3rd near my apartment. Checking out the latest exhibition at the Park Avenue Armory never gets old for me personally. I love strolling through the American Museum of National History to see the dinosaurs, or see what’s new at the Met. Note: The AMNH and The Met have a suggested donation admission fee-I usually just give a dollar, but you are encouraged to give whatever you can afford.After leaving the Met, I'm often tempted to get a hot waffle form the Wafels and Dinges truck with their famous speculoos spread, which basically tastes like crushed gingerbread cookie spread.<b></br></br>Breakfast-anywhere</b></br></br>I recommend solo dining virgins start small with breakfast. They can easily see that eating this morning meal alone shines light on the reality that everyone is on their way somewhere, and no one cares about anyone but themselves. Plus if you care to eat a double order of blueberry or pumpkin pancakes, you can do so without anyone knowing it, except your skinny pants. If I know I will have a busy day at work and will likely be unable to take a lunch break, I'll stop for a quick sit down breakfast at Cafe Habana (Price & Elizabeth Street in NoLIta). This fun cuban has a weekday Early Bird Breakfast Special for 2 eggs any style, homefries and toast for $3.25. Bonus points: they serve La Colombe coffee.<b></br></br>Lunch during the workweek</b></br></br>Going out for lunch during a 'lunch' break at work is much more civilized and healthy than eating at your desk. It's also a limited time commitment, which makes it feel less serious for some reason. Most lunch hours are an hour max, and with travel time they're usually 45 minutes. You can be alone for that amount of time, can't you? Sometimes when I'm really craving Mexican, I'll get a burrito from the Calexico cart and eat in one of the small parks near NYU.<b></br></br>Take photos</b></br></br>I enjoy taking lots of photos for my blog and exploring the city that many of my friends feel they have already seen, as they have lived in New York a year longer than I have. This is the perfect activity to venture out, take in parts of town you've never been to before, and do so without anyone by your side. Central Park, Bryant Park and The Highline are key outdoor spots for me. When it rains or snows in SoHo, I like to photograph the cobblestone streets. The Village, which reminds me of parts of Europe, offers some timeless photo ops as well.These and many more fly-solo options exist in NYC. These are merely a few of my personal favorites. It's a matter of finding out what you like to do without a friend, beau, or family member on your arm. </br></br>Rest assured, you’ll be sitting in your first solo movie fidgeting with a bag of popcorn and worrying that everyone is judging you for being alone. Or, you'll be wandering around Lower Manhattan with a digital camera in hand while couples and families mill about. For a moment, you might even forget you're alone at all. Because you're not. You're in New York.",

						"title":"5 Tips for Cooking in a Small NYC Kitchen","text":"<i> A spacious gourmet kitchen is one of those things many of us New Yorkers covet. We would love to create delectable dishes in a chef's setting, surrounded by hanging copper pots and a beautifully tiled backsplash. But unless we're one of the lucky few, our kitchens tend to be a narrow space within our apartment or part of an open-plan living room.</i></br></br>No biggie - even if your New York City apartment is short on space, you can still churn out delectable goodies by following these five tips for cooking in a small kitchen.<b></br>Organize your prep.<br></b>Cooking pros and fans of the Food Network will be familiar with the term 'mise en place'. This phrase means organizing and prepping your ingredients before the actual cooking process begins. If you're baking, measure everything out neatly into separate bowls and containers before mixing it all together. For full-on dinners, clean and chop your accoutrements, so everything is ready to go once your fire up the stovetop or oven. The more efficient you are with your prep work, the less clutter you'll accumulate during your time in the kitchen.<b></br>Keep a garbage bag handy.<br></b>I always save my plastic bags from Duane Reade and Fairway, so I can use them while I'm cooking. Having a small plastic bag handy makes it easy to throw garbage in as I go along, and I simply toss it down my apartment building's (very small) garbage chute once I'm finished.<b></br>Clean as you go.<br></b>As one can imagine, a small kitchen can get dirty extra fast. If you see some crumbs or spills on the countertop, take a couple of seconds to wipe up. Are dishes starting to pile up in the sink? Wash them while waiting for your food to cook, or load the dishwasher. If you're lucky enough to have one of LG's new ProBake ovens, featuring an'EasyClean' system that self-cleans in only ten minutes (most self-cleaning ovens take hours), then run a cleaning cycle while you're eating. It's so much easier to clean as you go along, than to tackle a huge mess later. <br><b>Use appropriate sized equipment.<br></b>That enormous Dutch oven and designer cutting board may look impressive, but they're simply not practical to use in a small kitchen. Instead, choose pots, pans, and cooking utensils that get the job done without taking up too much space.<b></br>Use shortcuts. <br></b>If you can make your life easier by buying precut veggies and other prepped ingredients, then do it. At the end of the day, it's about simplifying your cooking strategy, especially when you're short on space. And don't worry - your dishes will still be tasty, even if you implement a few shortcuts. LG's ProBake Convection technology makes cooking that much easier and convenient with features that aren’t typically available in commercial ovens. Not only is heat distributed more evenly, but your dishes will come out perfectly cooked regardless of where they're placed inside. Try baking a scrumptious dessert like in the video below, and taste the goodness yourself.",

						"title":"Working for a Magazine in NYC:What It's Really Like","text":"<i>Working for a magazine is definitely on the list of New York City dream jobs. Whether it's a news publication like TIME or a fashion magazine like Vogue, there's a lot of hype surrounding this type of gig. And ever since The Devil Wears Prada came out, folks make a lot of assumptions about what it's really like working for a Magazine in NYC.</i></br></br>For the past four years, I have been the national marketing director for the world's top bridal publication (one of my many 'day jobs'), and it's interesting to see what this seemingly glamorous occupation is really like. If you're considering a career at a magazine - or if you simply want an inside glimpse - here's what I've learned so far. </br><b>Glamorous? Not really. </b></br> Internships are the easiest way in. I've never worked as an intern, but it's one of the easiest ways to get your foot in the door. Many publications have a smaller team than one might assume, so job positions are not always readily available. </br><b> It's a prestige job - aka the pay probably isn't great.</br></b> It's fabulous if you land a job at Vogue, but don't assume you'll be buying designer labels anytime soon. And if you're a writer, keep in mind that many of the writers you see in the most iconic publications are typing away for free. Even a fashion editor - not to be confused with an assistant fashion editor - is a position that can take years to achieve, and the average salary is around $56K. The job title itself sounds pretty fancy though, right? Even I get a little giddy whenever my friends, from Hawaii to London, see a copy of my magazine on the newsstand and take a picture of my name printed in the masthead. Working for a magazine is a prestige job, but the pay isn't great in most instances. </br><b>The business side may be your best bet.</br></b>The top-paying jobs at magazines are usually those in finance and accounting. Sales and marketing are also great areas, because they're often commission positions with no earnings ceiling - so basically, you can potentially make six figures. Many magazines also allow their marketing and sales reps to work remotely from home like I do. Keep in mind, however, you'll need to be incredibly self-motivated and work even harder when communicating with your team and corporate office. </br><b>Your brain needs to be a Rolodex.</br></b> Think about it. A magazine is a go-to medium for information in a certain field. So if you're working for one, you need to be up-to-date on any related current events - and, even more importantly, you must know the who's who in your industry. That usually means logging hours of unpaid, independent research. When I first started out, I didn't know a thing about the bridal world. But now, after copious amounts of reading and taking notes, I can name the top vendors in almost any state or country, their key past clients, and their signature aesthetics. </br><b>Not all editors-in-chief are like Miranda Priestly.</br></b>There may be some truth to how The Devil Wears Prada depicted the boss of a fashion magazine, but trust me - they're not all like that. My editor-in-chief may look chic and luxurious, but she's also hilarious and down-to-earth. Even when I worked for a designer in London, two of our clients were the editors of the UK and French editions of Vogue. And they were lovely.</br><b>The perks are real.</b></br>Even though a magazine job can be arduous and you won't become a millionaire, there are fringe benefits that come with the territory (depending on your publication). My job perks have included VIP parties at places like the Rainbow Room, free concerts to scout new entertainment talent, overnight stays at luxury hotels, and bottles of champagne sent from my editor. I was even invited for a complimentary weeklong stay at a resort in Bali. When I factor all of that in, I'd say the opportunities, connections, and experiences that come with working for a magazine make it a job worth having.",

						"title":"Central Park in New York: Ten Things You Must Do","text":"<i>Yes, we know: You don't normally do touristy stuff. But it's always worth revisiting quintessentially New York experiences time and again-and what better place to explore than the big attractions in Central Park in New York?</i></br> </br><b>Stroll through the Conservatory Garden</br></b>Experience the charms of a European garden without having to, you know, fly to Europe. This six-acre garden offers three styles (French, Italian and English) and a plethora of flowers, fountains, neatly trimmed hedges and walkways. Just be prepared for the throng of edding photo shoots, and by that we mean be prepared for photo-bombing. East side from 104th to 106th Sts, enter at Fifth Ave and 105th StFree tours: Meet at Vanderbilt Gate, east side at 105th St; Sat 11am; free. Through Oct 26.</br><b>Watch the wheels go round and round at Strawberry Fields</br></b>Walk through this stretch of the park, just across the street from John and Yoko's residence at the Dakota. Renamed Strawberry Fields in '81, after Lennon's murder in front of that building several months earlier, the five-plus-acre area features the Imagine mosaic, where Beatle fans from across the world pay homage to the late great. But don't sing the ground's namesake tune too loudly, as Strawberry Fields is also a designated quiet zone. West side between 71st and 74th Sts, enter at Central Park West and 72nd St</br><b>Rock the boat</br></b>Take a romantic paddle around the Lake (hour $12, each additional 15mins $2.50, plus a $20 deposit)-or let someone else do the work, with a Venetian gondola ride (half hour $30). While you're there, absorb the picturesque view of the Lake at the Central Park Boathouse Restaurant, for fine-if pricey-fare like fish, crab cakes, salads and an assortment of wines. Midpark from 71st to 79th Sts, enter at Fifth Ave and 72nd St</br><b>Trip on shrooms at the Alice in Wonderland statue</br></b>Don't fret if the kiddies climb all over this bronze statue of Alice and company-that's what it's there for. Dedicated to the children of NYC and commissioned by George Delacorte after the passing of his wife, who enjoyed reading Alice to their children, the larger-than-life figures have been explored by children since 1959. Relive your youth and join them on the mushroom, or if you can't let go, read the engraved verses of the poem 'Jabberwocky,' by Alice scribe Lewis Carroll, portions of which line the sculpture. East side at 75th St, enter at Fifth Ave and 76th St</br><b>Monkey around at the Central Park Zoo</br></b>Animal lovers will dig the cute critters at the Tisch Children's Zoo, adjacent to the main zoo, where you can also get up close and personal with goats. In the Central Park Zoo itself, coo over the daily feeding of the sea lions and penguins, and watch Snow Monkeys leap playfully between rocks. East side between 63rd and 66th Sts, enter at Fifth Ave at 64th St (212-439-6500, centralparkzoo.com). Daily 10am-5:30pm. $12, seniors $9, children $7, children under 3 free.</br><b>Ride your pony</br></b>Experience the retro charm of bobbing along to organ music atop one of the Friedsam Memorial Carousel's 52 saddles. The carousel is in its third incarnation since 1871 (the original was horse-powered, and the next two were supposedly destroyed by fires), and the current version dates to 1950, when it was discovered in a Coney Island trolley terminal. Expect long waits, popcorn, hot dogs and a few crabby kids. Midpark at 64th St, enter at Fifth Ave and 64th St. Daily 10am–6pm (weather permitting). $2.50 per ride.</br><b>Climb up Belvedere Castle</br></b>Take in a sweeping view of the Great Lawn, the Ramble and Turtle Pond from Belvedere Castle, a folly built on one of the highest points in the park. Borrow a free discovery kit (requires two forms of ID, one of which is kept as a deposit) from inside the castle, which includes binoculars, a map and a guide for bird-watching in the Ramble's woods. Midpark at 79th St, enter at Fifth Ave and 72nd St. Free tours:Meet at Belvedere Castle, midpark at 79th St; dates and times vary, free.</br><b>Romance your beau on the Bow Bridge</br></b>New York has no shortage of bridges seemingly custom-made for gazing into a lover's eyes and sighing deeply, and this one, which spans some 60 feet over the Lake, is one of our faves. Yeah, it occasionally gets crowded with tourist couples snapping photos, but that's with good reason. Midpark at 74th St, enter at Central Park West and 72nd St</br><b>Get ready to Ramble</br></b>The winding trails, rocks and streams remain, seemingly waiting to be discovered. It's also the city's primo bird-watching spot, where you can view many of the park's 230 species.

Expect thousands of scantily-clad locals to take over the area on weekends. To secure a shaded spot, we suggest arriving at 11am, when the field opens.

						"title":"The Plaza Hotel: A New York City Classic ","text":"<i>It's no secret that NYC has more than its fair share of luxury hotels. I've attended magazine parties at the Pierre, and liquor brand launches at the Gansevoort - both, very memorable affairs with beautiful surroundings. Still, no hotel in this city is as historically significant and classically 'New York' as the Plaza.</i></br></br>Having celebrated its 100th birthday in 2007, the Plaza has become a cultural icon providing the backdrop for movies like Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, Barefoot in the Park, Arthur, and American Hustle. The hotel was also a source of inspiration for F. Scott Fitzgerald, who featured the hotel in The Great Gatsby.</br></br>Located at Fifth Avenue and Central Park South, this chateau-like hotel boasts prices averaging $1,000-plus per night, as well as condominiums starting around $2 million for a studio, and going up to more than $20 million for a four-bedroom unit. Fortunately for the average New Yorker (and tourist), there are several Plaza experiences that can be enjoyed without having to spend money like a Rockefeller.</br><b></br>Afternoon tea.</b></br></br>The Palm Court serves up a wonderful tea service while patrons are surrounded by stunning arches and potted palms. The menu features 'The New Yorker Tea,' which offers traditional British tea sandwiches and scones, but with a local twist. An impressive cocktail list is also available until 11 p.m.<b></br></br>Eloise parties.</b></br></br>What strikes me about the Plaza is that even though it's an upscale hotel, it's also very kid-friendly. The Eloise books, published in the 1950s, have made the hotel a venue for little girls to enjoy everything from tea time, to Eloise-themed birthday parties, to shopping at the Eloise boutique.<b></br></br>The champagne bar.</b></br></br>I absolutely love the Plaza's champagne bar, where we celebrated my friend Bekki's engagement party. The room is nothing short of luxurious, yet it'’'s extremely comfortable and doesn't feel too pretentious. I could lounge in the plush armchairs for hours. Also, they make one hell of a Bellini.<b></br></br>The Todd English Food Hall.</b></br></br>Whether someone is looking for a quick drink at the wine bar or hosting a private event, the Todd English Food Hall is a great place to visit. The cuisine is European-inspired, and customers can take their pick from nine different food stations including pizza, oysters, and patisserie. The Plaza Food Hall, an extension from Todd's, is also a favorite of mine and features vendors such as Luke's Lobster and Lady M (their signature multi-layered crepe cakes are amazing).</br></br>As a bit of a history nerd, along with the fact that I love all things posh, I consider the Plaza Hotel to be an absolute must-see. It's a perfect example of New York City's timelessness. Even as a local, the building's architecture, with horse-drawn carriages and Central Park as its backdrop, is a sight that never gets old.",

						"title":"7 Free New York City Date Ideas ","text":"<i>Sorry, everywhere else - New York City is one of the most romantic places in the world. Not only do we have When Harry Met Sally, Serendipity, 13 Going on 30, and plenty of other rom-coms to prove it, but we have some of the best date spots on the planet. Don't believe us? Here are seven great NYC date ideas (that also happen to be free)!</i></br><br><b></br></br>People watch at Smorgasburg.</b></br></br>What better excuse to hop on the L train and explore a new neighborhood? Pick a spot on the grass where you can watch the crowd (inclusive of both hipsters and tourists) hustle from one booth to the next. There's also a small beach with a gorgeous view of the Manhattan skyline, which is perfect for romantic gazing.<b></br></br>Attend a free movie screening.</b></br></br>You'd be surprised how many films screen for free in New York City! During the summer, the Central Park Conservancy and Coney Island Beach host outdoor screenings, but there are just as many during the winter. Videology in Williamsburg shows films at their half-bar-half-DVD rental location, and Gotham West Market regularly screens films on Tuesday evenings.<b></br></br>Walk tip-to-tip in Manhattan.</b></br></br>Looking to get active? Grab your sneakers, pack some snacks, and ride the A train to the northern tip of Manhattan. Get off the subway and start moving south. The 13-mile walk will take up most of your day, but getting to view attractions such as the High Line, Cathedral of Saint John the Divine, Central Park, and other major landmarks in less than 24 hours feels like quite the adventure.<b></br></br>Get lost in The Strand Bookstore.</b></br></br>Forget 13 miles of walking - how about 8 miles of books? You'll find great deals on bestsellers and favorites from your childhood, plus the works on display in The Strand's rare book room equal what you'd find in the Met.<b></br></br>Tour graffiti art in Bushwick.</b></br></br>Explore the remaining warehouses in Brooklyn (that haven't yet been converted into apartments) and see some amazing art along the way. Morgan Avenue and Moore Street are great places to start. You may not find the next Banksy, but be sure to bring your camera! The art you'll find could be your next perfect Instagram shot.<b></br></br>Play hide and seek in the Times Square Forever 21.</b></br></br>Yes, the four levels of clothes might be for ''shopping,'' but with hours of operation that last until 2 a.m. and a prime location in the heart of Manhattan, it's a great way to celebrate the kid within. There's no need to feel embarrassed when playing - odds are, the employees have thought of doing the same.<b></br></br>Take a free tour of the New York Public Library.</b></br></br>Both the Stephen A. Schwarzman Building and the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture offer free tours throughout the week. The lineup includes access to exhibitions, which range from art to history to classic literature. </br></br><i>What's stopping you from going on that hot New York City date you've been dreaming about? </i>",

						"title":"Sunday Funday in Coney Island","text":"<i>Coney Island-New York City's legendary amusement district-is not a theme park. Six Flags Great Adventure and Disneyland are nice places to spend some time, but they are gated, hermetically sealed worlds that cut visitors off from reality. This is something different: a seaside playground that's also a real-life NYC neighborhood. Its appeal comes not from a single source but from the combined force of its many individual attractions. On a bright summer day, no place feels more electric.</i></br></br>It starts with the awesome wooden Cyclone roller coaster (complete with what may be the most terrifying first drop in the universe), which remains the area's centerpiece after more than 85 years. In recent years, the folks behind the revived Luna Park have taken over management of the Cyclone and added such thrill rides as a human slingshot (we're not first in line for that one…but it's there!) and, as a rival to the Cyclone, the reinvented Thunderbolt, a 2014 addition that pays homage to another coaster built in the 1920s. The carnival atmosphere wouldn't be complete without Sideshows by the Seashore, an outrageous cavalcade of curiosities headlined by stars with colorful names like the Black Scorpion. For those with simpler tastes in summer fun, a dip in the ocean might suffice; the beach is right off the boardwalk. Other essential Coney Island attractions include Cyclones baseball at MCU Park, the New York Aquarium and the original Nathan's Famous, home of the world's most renowned eating competition: the Fourth of July Hot Dog Eating Contest. Russian enclave Brighton Beach is just a few wooden planks away, and you can fuel your foot-powered journey there with some clams, funnel cake or other seaside specialties from vendors along the boardwalk.</br></br>It's an understatement to say that Coney Island has faced its share of challenges over the years. But the longtime business owners there, many of whom have had a stake in the area for decades, plan on sticking around for a long while. ''Coney Island's been around since the late 1800s,'' says Michael Sarrel, an owner of Ruby's Bar & Grill,''and we want to make sure it stays around until the late 2100s.''<b></br></br>Luna Park</b></br></br>The modern incarnation of Luna Park, now in its fifth year, boasts such rides as the Tickler, a spinning Wild Mouse-style roller coaster featuring maddeningly tight turns; the speedy Air Race, which subjects riders to forces of four Gs-up to 25% more than a space shuttle launch would; and the Wild River log flume, with its 40-foot splash landing. More extreme thrill seekers may enjoy such rides as the Sling Shot (in which participants are shot into the air at 90 miles per hour). It's classic Coney Island fun at a place that takes its name and aesthetic from one of the ''Nickel Empir'' parks of yore-the old Luna Park, which operated from 1903 until it was destroyed by fire in 1944. The crescent moon and pinwheel motif will look familiar to anyone who remembers the original. And while the rides cost money, it's free to enter and poke around. <b></br></br>The Cyclone</b></br></br>Think 'Coney Island' and this roller coaster'is likely the first image that comes to mind. Heck, think 'roller coaster' and the Cyclone might be the first thing that comes to mind. The ride's famous 85-foot first drop and harrowing barrage of 60-mile-per-hour twists and turns have inspired extreme reactions of either fanatical devotion or lifelong terror since 1927. Just ask the ride's biggest enthusiasts-the fear that your car might fly off the track at any time is part of the fun. Riding in the front car affords riders the best view, while sitting in the rear gives the feeling of greater speed. Whether you ride or just watch (and listen to the screams), it's a must-visit summertime destination. <b></br></br>Nathan's Famous</b></br></br>Ah, Nathan's: home to some of the world's favorite hot dogs and host of its most famous eating competition, the Fourth of July Hot Dog Eating Contest, during which superhuman competitors-who train and strategize relentlessly-try to eat as many as possible in 10 short minutes (see our roundup of weird sporting events for more details). Founded in 1916 by Polish immigrant Nathan Handwerker, Nathan's Famous is an enduring testament to New York City's multicultural tradition, its culinary prowess and its sense of fun. It's not all about hot dogs, either-the french fries and clams are popular choices as well. You can even buy frog's legs at the Surf Avenue location, if you dare. Whatever you plan to get, save the meal for after you ride the Cyclone or Thunderbolt. <b></br></br>New York Aquarium</b></br></br>This aquarium-the oldest continually operating example in the US-remains a must-see destination on Coney Island's celebrated boardwalk. Visitors will be charmed by all manner of sea life, including seals, walruses, red-bellied piranhas and rays. Long-range planners can look forward to the opening of Ocean Wonders: Sharks!, which will feature blacktip and whitetip reef sharks, sand tiger sharks and wobbegongs, a carpet shark native to the western Pacific and eastern Indian Oceans. Look for it to open spring 2017. More immediate gratification can be had from viewing the daily penguin and otter feedings.",

						"title":"New York Subway Commuting for Dummies","text":"<i>One of the advantages of living in New York is the public transit system. With myriad buses and trains, you can get anywhere you want for $2.50 each way. But navigating the rush hour commute can be confusing and even painful until you're a veteran. To make your time on public transit run smoothly, here are my 9 bits of advice for the newbie NYC subway commuter.</i></br></br><b>1. Do a practice run.</b></br></br>Actors, athletes, and even politicians rehearse, and so should you. If you have a transfer, take some time the weekend before and map out your route. Remember, you live here now, so act like it and don’t meander around the stations like a lost child. You have now graduated from the little kids table to the adult table, so do your homework and be prepared. <b></br></br>2. Be Nice.</b></br></br>To quote Patrick Swayze from the 1989 classic Road House (Yes, it is a classic!), 'Be nice.' And, be assertive. You'll get no respect in this town by being a D-bag, but on the same note, don't be afraid to stand your ground. Also, use some judgment. If the dude cutting you off looks like he has nothing to lose, he probably doesn't, so let it go. Otherwise, treat people as you wish to be treated, and you'll be surprised how nice your fellow commuters will be. And if you have the chance, give up your seat if you see an elderly person or a pregnant woman. I promise you will be proud of yourself when you do. Plus, that hottie standing across the way will notice, as well.<b></br></br>3. Less is more.</b></br></br>Simply put, carry the absolute bare minimum you can stand. You'll learn this quickly if you have to walk a few avenues. Also, take the backpack off your back if you are on a crowded train. Getting assaulted by someone's North Face pack while they twist and turn trying to get settled in their 12 inch by 12 inch spot is annoying. (That's usually the most space any passenger will have on the subway at rush hour.) Take the thing off and place it between your feet. If you have to ask why, see point #2 or move back to the Midwest.<b></br></br>4. Don't push.</b></br></br>We are all late, but pushing to get onto an already overcrowded train is uncalled for. Keep in mind, in the morning most trains run every few minutes. In other words see point #2 and don't be a jackhole.<b></br></br>5. Move into the car.</b></br></br>Unless your stop is the next one, you should not be near the doors. You'll feel like you're in a mosh pit as people try to get on and off the train. This being said, if you are in the way, step off the train and let people out. There is an unwritten rule that people who step off are the first to get back on.<b></br></br>6. Stay alert.</b></br></br>You are grooving to the latest jams from Sir Mix-A-Lot (do not make fun of me - he is coming back) and escape into your own little world. While cramming against 20 of your new best friends, be aware that when the train stops, people will want to get past you (see point #5). In other words, enjoy the remix of 'Baby Got Back,' but keep your eyes open.<b></br></br>7. Get off the phone.</b></br></br>At times, it is now possible to have cell service on the train, but no one wants to hear about what Brad said to Joe about Diane who is simply sick about what happened to Alice. Send a text -- end of story.<b></br></br>8. Know your personal space.</b></br></br>If you have to reach over my shoulder to grab a bar securing your front side to my back side, we are in effect 'spooning.' Unless your name is Tracy Kaler (or Kate Upton), this will not be tolerated. If you offer to buy me a drink afterward, we can talk, but otherwise, this is NOT happening. I understand that you are reaching for a bar to secure your footing so you do not fall over when the train is moving. I get it, but when we are stuffed into the car like sardines, you don't have very far to fall. So I reiterate, NO SPOONING ALLOWED.<b></br></br>9. Try not to annoy other passengers. Specifically:</b></br></br> -Do not wear sunglasses unless you're having a mid '80s Cory Hart moment, you'll look like a weirdo wearing sunglasses on a subway. If you were born post 1979, Google 'Cory Hart.' </br>-Do not leave your bag on an empty seat if the train is crowded. Do I really need to explain why? See point #2. </br>-If you must eat please make sure your food does not smell and will not end up on my Peacoat. Granola bars are good. Chinese food is not!</br>-If you must cough or sneeze, cover your stinking pie hole. Trains are a human petri dish! As a new New Yorker you should always have a tissue, two, or twenty in your bag.</br></br>This list is just a primer to get you started, and hopefully avoid some amateur mistakes that so many of us made on our first few go-arounds. Follow the above, and you'll be riding the subway like a seasoned New Yorker in no time.",

						"title":"10 Types of People You Meet at an NYC Bar","text":"<i>I've spent a good part of the past five or so years (what fake ID?!) at New York City bars. While there is a huge diversity among bar-goers, bartenders, and bar tabs (an $18 cocktail at JIMMY at the James is not always a mistake, while $1 beers at Jake's Dilemma are cool too...), I've noticed a pattern among some of the standard NYC barflies you're destined to meet during a night out.</i></br></br><b>1. The Single Guy.</b> This is pretty typical for bars anywhere, but the NYC single guy is, of course, a bit different. He will:</br>a) Take any opportunity to talk to anything in a dress or heels. Perhaps buy her a drink while swiveling around on his stool to see if he made the best choice in the bar.<br>or</br>b) Default to...</br></br><b>2. The Wingman.</b> He may be married, but he's using his best friend status as a way to hit on girls without the risk.</br></br><b>3. The tourist. </b>This isn't the tourist trying to fit in, this is the tourist who can easily be recognized by a combination of maps, an enormous camera, and perhaps a massive backpack. He can be seen reading his guidebook in the candlelight of the dim bar, or perhaps asking for 'local' suggestions. </br></br><b>4. The drunk guy.</b> Hopefully he's also a tourist, and hopefully from somewhere with as rich a culture as Ireland, so he'll exclaim things like, 'A round of Jameson for everyone!' </br></br><b>5. The Sorority Reunion girls.</b> There's always that big table of girls that more often than not sometimes makes me embarrassed of my gender. Shrieking and giggling and ordering things like Sex on the Beach, I usually want to sit as far away from this table as possible. </br></br><b>6. The First Date couple.</b> This is usually obvious because these people met via the Internet, the most effective way to meet a romantic partner in a city of millions. If you're sitting anywhere in the vicinity of this couple, you can sense the awkward tension between them while discussing their families, careers, and debating whether or not to go for another beer. (Pro tip: always ask the other person before you go for another drink, to avoid lingering in awkward conversation someone doesn't want to be a part of). </br></br><b>7.  The Guinness Guy.</b> This guy (or sometimes girl) sits all alone in a dark counter of the bar, pondering life over a dark pint of beer, not bothering to talk to anyone, nor is he interesting in making conversation. He may have a notebook or just the impermeability to stare into space. Sometimes I wish I could be this person, but I hate Guinness. </br></br><b>8. The Not-Bartender. </b>While there are plenty of talented mixologists in this city, there are plenty of people in the service industry who are just trying to pay the bills while pursuing other creative endeavors. The Not-Bartender is fine at pouring your drinks, but also is eager to chat with you about her stand-up comedy/indie published novella/ scrapbooking company, whether or not you want to hear about it. Props to them though, you never know who you'll connect with in NYC! </br></br><b>9. The Sneak.</b> This person orders soda and spikes it with a flask brought from home in order to cut costs. NYC drink prices are expensive, but come on, this is just tacky. And rude!</br></br><b>10. The Regular. </b>There are so many bars in NYC, it's important to be able to find one you can call home, where everybody knows your name, and your drink order. As 'The Regular' at the bar below my apartment, I can say with confidence that I am a staple in their scene. I go on vacation and everyone wonders where I am (I assume), I stop in for Tuesday happy hour and greet the other regulars (whose names I honestly don't know), and it's like a scene out of Cheers. Or How I Met Your Mother. ",
